# Small Machine

Distribution of ModularCM with extra custom-made modules

## What are the extra modules?

### Graphite

Graphite is just like QuickBoot except it also adds UI compatibility

### CarbonCE

CarbonCE is a cell environment made for Graphite that makes the game look *fancy*.

### MoreCells

It adds more cells for fun lol

## Are these packages only for Small Machine?

No. They have been made in a way where they can work without eachother, and thus don't need to be thrown in Small Machine.

While there is no easy way to get them, you can copy the folders of the packages and put them in your other installs.
